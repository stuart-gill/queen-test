# Queen Test

## Description

In chess, a queen can move horizontally, vertically, and diagonally, making it the most powerful piece on the board. If another piece is within its line of sight along these three lines, then the queen can attack it.

This is an app where the user can enter an X and a Y coordinate for the queen, and an X and a Y coordinate for another chess piece which the queen is attacking.
